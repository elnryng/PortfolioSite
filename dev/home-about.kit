        <p class="bio-text"> Hey there! My name is Eleanor and I’m an interdisciplinary  graphic designer based in Philadelphia. </p>
        <p class="bio-text">I believe that visual designs have the ability to leave a lasting impression on those that see them, and I strive to create interesting and unique human-centric graphics, logos, & websites that speak to everyone. </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
            When I’m not designing, I can be found curating my next playlist, critically analyzing film and television, or workshopping my brownie recipe.
